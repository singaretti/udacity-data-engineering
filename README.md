# data-modeling-with-postgres@udacity-data-engineering  


**Overview**
    
*This project aims to prepare an environment to analyze how customers enjoy songs using our app, Sparkify.*


**Data Source:**

- Song Data : these files are ingest in songs table and artist table;

- Log Data: these files are necessary to fill time table and users table.

With these four tables, it's possible to use Fact table called Songplays. To keep songplays table updated, it's necessary to keep running etl.py.
